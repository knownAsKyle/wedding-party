Broken lamp, he’d be next to me pointing and looking away.  Playing cabin baseball, just behind me in the batting order. </p><p> My wedding … well at this point it’s pretty much expected. </p>",

When we get together, we will usually end up yelling “Our moms are best friends!” to anyone and everyone around. </p><p>We share a love of goofiness, have the same youthful spirit for Harry Potter and Webkinz, and truly believe we can read each other’s minds.</p>",
